# Kaggle-ChestXrayScans
Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) Classification

My partner Julian and myself made this project as part of a Data Science course we took at The Open University.
In this project we went through exploring, preprocessing, organizing and examining the data.
We created models for classification and conclude the results.
